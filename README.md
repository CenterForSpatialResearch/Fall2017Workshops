# Fall 2017 CSR Workshops


Tutorials and Resources for Fall 2017 GIS Workshops at the [Center for Spatial Research](http://c4sr.columbia.edu). Led by Dare Brawley.

The Center for Spatial Research fall 2017 workshop series is designed to give a basic introduction to core concepts and methods for work with geographic information systems in the urban humanities. The hands-on workshop series aims to contribute to existing campus-wide GIS resources, and is thus tailored to students doing coursework and research in the urban humanities with no prior GIS experience. It is open to students from all schools at Columbia University.

Further information about the workshops is available [here](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/news/fall-2017-gis-workshops).

Registration for fall 2017 workshops is now closed. Information about registration for spring workshops will be available [here](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/news/) at the start of the spring 2018 semester.
