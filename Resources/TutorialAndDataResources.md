###A Few Resources for Researching Spatial Data

**Places to Start**

* Columbia University Libraries, specifically the [Research Data Services](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/dssc/data/service.html) (formerly, Digital Social Sciences Center), at Lehman Library:
	* The DSSC maintains the Columbia University [Spatial Data Catalog](https://geodata.library.columbia.edu) which lists all spatial data held by the Columbia Libraries
	* The DSSC also maintains research guides for how to find spatial data from other sources and libraries. 

### Digitized Map Collections

The following are a few links to major resources for researching digitized historic map collections.

**Places to Start**

* Columbia University Libraries, specifically the [Digital Social Sciences Center,](http://library.columbia.edu/services/research-data-services.html) at Lehman Library:
	* [GIS and Spatial Data Research Guide](http://guides.library.columbia.edu/c.php?g=715646&p=5092264)
	* The DSSC is the home of the [Lehman Map Collection](http://library.columbia.edu/locations/maps/about.html)
	* [GeoData @ Columbia](http://geodata.cul.columbia.edu) is a tool for searching Columbia's spatial data holdings including historical maps, by location. 

* Other University libraries often maintain listings of good online historical map resources
